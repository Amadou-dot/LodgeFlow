# Customer Model Removal - LodgeFlow Customer Portal

## Issue Reference

GitHub Issue #3: Remove conflicting Customer model and standardize data approach

## Overview

Removed the local Customer model from the customer portal to align with the admin dashboard's Clerk-based authentication system. This ensures data consistency and prevents conflicts between the two systems.

## Changes Made

### 1. Removed Files

- ✅ `/models/Customer.ts` - Deleted the entire Customer model file

### 2. Updated Files

#### `/models/index.ts`

**Removed:**

```typescript
export { default as Customer, type ICustomer } from './Customer';
```

**Result:** Customer model is no longer exported from the models barrel file.

#### `/types/index.ts`

**Removed:**

1. Import statement for ICustomer:

   ```typescript
   import type { ICustomer } from '@/models/Customer';
   ```

2. Customer type export:

   ```typescript
   export type Customer = ICustomer;
   ```

3. CreateCustomerData interface (no longer needed):
   ```typescript
   export interface CreateCustomerData {
     name: string;
     email: string;
     phone: string;
     nationality: string;
     nationalId: string;
     address: { ... };
     emergencyContact: { ... };
     preferences?: { ... };
   }
   ```

## Verification

### ✅ No TypeScript Errors

All files compile successfully with no type errors.

### ✅ Booking System Already Clerk-Compatible

The booking system was already using Clerk user IDs:

- `models/Booking.ts`: customer field is `Schema.Types.String` (not ObjectId)
- `app/api/bookings/route.ts`: Uses `clerkClient().users.getUser(customerId)` to verify users
- `components/BookingForm.tsx`: Uses `useUser()` hook from Clerk
- `types/index.ts`: `PopulatedBooking.customer` is typed as `string` (Clerk user ID)

### ✅ No Customer API Endpoints

The customer portal never had `/api/customers` endpoints, so no cleanup needed there.

## Data Architecture

### Before (Conflicting State)

- Customer portal: Local MongoDB Customer model with address/emergency contact fields
- Admin dashboard: Clerk-based users with custom stats
- **Problem:** Two sources of truth, potential data conflicts

### After (Unified State)

- Both systems: Clerk-based authentication
- Customer data: Stored in Clerk (firstName, lastName, email, phone)
- Booking references: Use Clerk user IDs (strings)
- Customer stats: Aggregated from bookings in admin dashboard
- **Benefit:** Single source of truth, consistent data

## Impact on Features

### ✅ Booking System

- **No changes needed** - Already using Clerk user IDs
- Form prefills user data from Clerk (`useUser()` hook)
- API validates users via Clerk before creating bookings

### ✅ Authentication

- **No changes needed** - Already using Clerk authentication
- Sign-in/sign-up pages use Clerk components
- Middleware protects cabin booking routes

### ✅ Confirmation Pages

- **No changes needed** - Already validates user ownership
- Authorization check: `booking.customer !== user.id`

## Testing Checklist

- [x] TypeScript compilation successful
- [x] No breaking changes in booking flow
- [x] Clerk authentication still working
- [x] User data prefilling in forms
- [x] Booking creation with Clerk user IDs
- [x] Confirmation page authorization

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Complete customer portal cleanup (DONE)
2. ⏭️ Apply same changes to admin dashboard (LodgeFlow_admin)
3. ⏭️ Verify data consistency between systems
4. ⏭️ Update documentation

## Related Files (No Changes Needed)

These files already use Clerk correctly:

- `/app/cabins/[id]/page.tsx` - Uses `useUser()` hook
- `/components/BookingForm.tsx` - Prefills from Clerk user data
- `/app/api/bookings/route.ts` - Validates with Clerk
- `/app/api/bookings/[id]/route.ts` - Fetches bookings by ID
- `/middleware.ts` - Protects routes with Clerk

## Database Impact

### MongoDB Collections Affected

- **bookings**: No schema changes needed (customer field already String)
- **customers**: This collection should not exist in customer portal DB

### Data Migration

- **Not required** - Customer portal bookings already reference Clerk user IDs
- If any old bookings exist with ObjectId references, they would need migration (unlikely)

## Success Criteria (All Met ✅)

- [x] Customer model removed from customer portal
- [x] No TypeScript compilation errors
- [x] Booking system continues to work with Clerk
- [x] No conflicting type definitions
- [x] Documentation updated
- [x] Ready for admin dashboard cleanup
