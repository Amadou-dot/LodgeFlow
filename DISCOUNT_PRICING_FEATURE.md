# Discount Pricing Feature Implementation

## Overview
This document describes the implementation of the Discount Pricing feature in the Booking Form, as specified in GitHub Issue #16.

## Implementation Date
October 16, 2025

## Files Modified

### Updated Files
- `/components/BookingForm.tsx` - Enhanced to display and calculate discount pricing
- `/app/cabins/[id]/page.tsx` - Updated to pass discount data to BookingForm

### New Files
- `/__tests__/bookings/BookingFormDiscount.test.tsx` - Comprehensive test suite
- `/DISCOUNT_PRICING_FEATURE.md` - This documentation

## Features Implemented

### 1. Visual Price Display
- ✅ Original price shown with strikethrough when discount exists
- ✅ Discounted price displayed prominently in green
- ✅ Per-night savings message ("Save $X/night!")
- ✅ Capacity information displayed separately for better readability

### 2. Pricing Calculation Logic
- ✅ Effective price calculated as `regularPrice - discount`
- ✅ Total calculation uses discounted price
- ✅ Original total displayed with strikethrough
- ✅ Total savings highlighted in green background

### 3. Pricing Breakdown Section
- ✅ Shows original pricing (struck through) when discount exists
- ✅ Displays effective pricing per night
- ✅ Highlights total savings in a green badge
- ✅ Clear separation between original and final totals
- ✅ Maintains tax disclaimer

### 4. Edge Case Handling
- ✅ Zero discount: Displays regular pricing (no discount UI)
- ✅ 100% discount (free): Shows $0/night with savings message
- ✅ Undefined discount: Treats as 0, displays regular pricing
- ✅ Partial discounts: Calculates correctly for any discount amount

## Technical Implementation

### Interface Updates
```typescript
interface BookingFormProps {
  cabin: {
    _id: string;
    name: string;
    regularPrice: number;
    discount?: number;  // NEW: Optional discount field
    maxCapacity: number;
    image?: string;
  };
  // ... other props
}
```

### Calculation Logic
```typescript
const regularPrice = cabin?.regularPrice || 0;
const discount = cabin?.discount || 0;
const effectivePrice = regularPrice - discount;
const hasDiscount = discount > 0;

// Total calculation
const subtotal = nights * effectivePrice;
const originalTotal = nights * regularPrice;
const totalSavings = hasDiscount ? originalTotal - subtotal : 0;
```

### Visual Hierarchy
1. **Header Pricing** (when discount exists):
   - Struck-through original price in gray
   - Large discounted price in green
   - Savings message in bold green
   - Capacity on separate line

2. **Breakdown Section**:
   - Original calculation (struck through)
   - Effective calculation (normal weight)
   - Savings badge (green background)
   - Final total (bold, green)

## Testing

All 10 unit tests passing:

### Display Tests
- ✅ Regular price without discount display
- ✅ Price calculation without discount
- ✅ Strikethrough for original price with discount
- ✅ Prominent discounted price display
- ✅ Savings message display
- ✅ Capacity information layout with discount

### Edge Case Tests
- ✅ Zero discount handling
- ✅ 100% discount (free cabin) handling
- ✅ Undefined discount handling

### Access Control
- ✅ Sign-in requirement message

## UI/UX Improvements

### Visual Clarity
- Strikethrough for original prices makes discount obvious
- Green color scheme for savings reinforces positive messaging
- Hierarchical typography guides eye to important information
- Consistent spacing maintains clean layout

### Information Architecture
- Price per night prominently displayed in header
- Detailed breakdown available for transparency
- Savings highlighted but not overwhelming
- Total remains clear focal point

### Mobile Responsiveness
- All discount displays fully responsive
- Text sizes appropriate for all viewports
- No horizontal scrolling required
- Touch-friendly spacing maintained

## Accessibility Considerations
- Semantic HTML structure preserved
- Color not sole indicator (text also communicates discount)
- Sufficient contrast ratios maintained
- Screen reader friendly content structure

## Performance
- No additional API calls required
- Calculations performed client-side
- Instant UI updates
- No performance impact on rendering

## Browser Compatibility
Tested and compatible with:
- Modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Mobile browsers (iOS Safari, Chrome Mobile)
- Dark and light themes supported

## Future Enhancements
Potential improvements for future iterations:
- Discount expiration dates/timers
- Promotional code integration
- Bulk booking discounts
- Loyalty program integration
- Seasonal pricing adjustments
- Last-minute deal badges

- Part of #14 - Cabin Page Enhancements Phase 2
- Addresses GitHub Issue #16

## Dependencies
- No new dependencies added
- Uses existing HeroUI components
- Leverages existing cabin data structure
- Compatible with current authentication flow

## Migration Notes
- Discount field is optional in cabin props
- Backwards compatible with cabins without discounts
- No database migrations required (field already exists)
- Safe to deploy without data changes
