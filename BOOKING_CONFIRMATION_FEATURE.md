# Booking Confirmation Feature

## Overview

Implemented a dedicated booking confirmation page that users are redirected to after successfully submitting a booking request, replacing the previous toast notification system.

## Files Created

### 1. `/app/cabins/confirmation/[id]/page.tsx`

**Purpose**: Dedicated confirmation page displaying complete booking details

**Features**:

- **Authorization Check**: Verifies that the logged-in user matches the booking's customer ID
- **Booking Details Display**: Shows cabin image, booking dates, guests, nights, and booking ID
- **Extras & Services**: Displays all selected additional services with pricing
- **Special Requests**: Lists any special requests submitted by the user
- **Price Breakdown**: Detailed pricing including cabin cost, extras, total, and deposit
- **Status Indicator**: Shows current booking status with a chip component
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of missing/unauthorized bookings with user-friendly messages

**Components Used**:

- HeroUI: Card, Button, Chip, Divider, Spinner
- Lucide React: CheckCircle, XCircle, Home icons
- Next.js: Image, Link, useRouter

### 2. `/app/api/bookings/[id]/route.ts`

**Purpose**: API endpoint to fetch a single booking by ID

**Functionality**:

- GET request handler
- Fetches booking from MongoDB by ID
- Populates cabin details
- Returns structured API response with success/error handling

## Files Modified

### 1. `/components/BookingForm.tsx`

**Changes**:

- Added `useRouter` import from Next.js navigation
- Removed success toast notification
- Updated `onSuccess` callback to redirect to confirmation page using booking ID
- Kept error toast for failure scenarios

**Before**:

```typescript
onSuccess: () => {
  addToast({
    title: 'Success',
    description: 'Your booking request has been submitted!',
    color: 'success',
  });
  setDateRange(null);
  setNumberOfGuests('');
};
```

**After**:

```typescript
onSuccess: response => {
  if (response.data && response.data._id) {
    router.push(`/cabins/confirmation/${response.data._id}`);
  } else {
    addToast({
      title: 'Success',
      description: 'Your booking request has been submitted!',
      color: 'success',
    });
  }
};
```

### 2. `/hooks/useBooking.ts`

**Changes**:

- Updated return type of `mutationFn` to include the full API response structure
- Changed from `Promise<Booking>` to `Promise<{ success: boolean; data: Booking; message?: string }>`
- Allows access to booking ID in the response for redirect

## Security Features

### Authorization Check

The confirmation page implements a strict authorization check:

```typescript
if (user && booking && booking.customer !== user.id) {
  return (
    // Unauthorized access message with XCircle icon
    // Shows error card with "Return to Cabins" button
  );
}
```

**Benefits**:

- Prevents users from viewing other users' booking confirmations
- Clear, user-friendly unauthorized message
- Provides quick navigation back to cabin listings

## User Experience Improvements

### Before (Toast System)

- Brief success notification that disappears
- No way to review booking details after submission
- User had to rely on email for confirmation

### After (Confirmation Page)

- Permanent confirmation page with unique URL
- Complete booking details immediately available
- Professional confirmation experience
- Shareable booking confirmation link
- Clear visual success indicator (green checkmark)
- Comprehensive pricing breakdown
- Information about next steps (email confirmation)

## UI/UX Details

### Success State

- Large green checkmark icon
- "Booking Request Submitted!" header
- Clear status chip showing booking state
- Informative subtitle about next steps

### Booking Information Cards

1. **Booking Summary**: Dates, cabin name, nights, guests, booking ID
2. **Additional Services**: Selected extras with pricing chips
3. **Price Breakdown**: Itemized costs with totals
4. **Next Steps**: Email confirmation notice

### Color Consistency

- Uses HeroUI's color system: `primary`, `success`, `warning`, `danger`
- Consistent with the rest of the application
- Green for success states and pricing
- Warning yellow for status chips and deposits
- Primary blue for action buttons

## Dependencies Added

### lucide-react

```bash
pnpm add lucide-react
```

**Icons Used**:

- `CheckCircle`: Success indicator
- `XCircle`: Error/unauthorized indicator
- `Home`: Navigation button icon

## API Flow

1. User submits booking form
2. POST `/api/bookings` - Creates booking
3. Returns booking object with `_id`
4. Client redirects to `/cabins/confirmation/[id]`
5. Confirmation page fetches booking via GET `/api/bookings/[id]`
6. Authorization check performed
7. Booking details displayed

## Error Handling

### Booking Not Found

- Shows XCircle icon
- "Booking Not Found" message
- Error details from API
- "Return to Cabins" button

### Unauthorized Access

- Shows XCircle icon
- "Unauthorized Access" message
- Clear explanation of why access is denied
- "Return to Cabins" button

### Loading State

- Spinner with "Loading booking details..." label
- Prevents premature rendering

## Future Enhancements

Potential additions:

- Print/PDF download of confirmation
- Email confirmation resend option
- Social sharing buttons
- Add to calendar functionality
- Booking modification/cancellation links
- Real-time status updates via WebSocket/polling
