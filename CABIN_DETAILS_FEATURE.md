## Technical Implementation

### Component Architecture
```typescript
interface Cabin {
  _id: string;
  name: string;
  price: number;
  capacity: number;
  image: string;
  discount: number;
  description: string;
  amenities: string[];
}

interface CabinDetailsProps {
  cabin: Cabin;
}
```

### Amenity Icon Mapping
The component includes an intelligent icon mapping system that:
1. Attempts exact string matches first
2. Falls back to case-insensitive partial matching
3. Provides a fallback checkmark for unmapped amenities

### Layout Structure
The cabin page now uses a responsive two-column layout:
- **Desktop (lg screens)**: 2/3 width for cabin details, 1/3 for booking form
- **Mobile/Tablet**: Stacked single column layout
- Booking form is sticky on desktop for better UX

### Styling Approach
- Uses HeroUI Card components for consistent design
- Tailwind CSS for responsive utilities
- Lucide-react icons for modern, crisp visuals
- Primary color theme throughout for brand consistency

## Testing
All acceptance criteria tested and passing:
- ✅ 6/6 unit tests passing
- ✅ Description rendering
- ✅ Amenities display with icons
- ✅ Cabin information display
- ✅ House rules section
- ✅ Edge cases (no amenities, single guest)

## Responsive Design
- Mobile-first approach
- Breakpoints: sm (640px), lg (1024px)
- Grid columns adjust based on screen size
- Proper spacing and padding for all viewports

## Accessibility Considerations
- Semantic HTML structure
- Proper heading hierarchy (h2 for section titles)
- Icon + text combinations for clarity
- Sufficient color contrast
- Screen reader friendly content

## Future Enhancements
Potential improvements for future iterations:
- Make house rules configurable per cabin
- Add image gallery integration
- Include nearby attractions section
- Add guest reviews/ratings section
- Implement dynamic pricing calendar view
- Add "Share" and "Save" functionality
