              What began as a dream to create a perfect escape from the modern
              world has evolved into a premier destination that honors both
              luxury and nature's raw beauty.

              Founded by environmental enthusiasts Sarah and Michael Chen,
              LodgeFlow was born from their vision of sustainable luxury
              tourism. After years of traveling the world, they discovered this
              untouched valley and knew they had found something special.
            </p>
            <p>
              Today, our resort spans over {pristineAcres} acres of protected
              wilderness, featuring {cabinCount} thoughtfully designed cabins
              that blend seamlessly into the natural landscape. Each structure
              was built using sustainable materials and powered by renewable
              energy.
