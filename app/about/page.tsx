              What began as a dream to create a perfect escape from the modern
              world has evolved into a premier destination that honors both
              luxury and nature's raw beauty.
            </p>
            <p>
              Founded by environmental enthusiasts Sarah and Michael Chen,
              LodgeFlow was born from their vision of sustainable luxury
              tourism. After years of traveling the world, they discovered this
              untouched valley and knew they had found something special.
            </p>
            <p>
              Today, our resort spans over 500 acres of protected wilderness,
              featuring 12 thoughtfully designed cabins that blend seamlessly
              into the natural landscape. Each structure was built using
              sustainable materials and powered by renewable energy.
